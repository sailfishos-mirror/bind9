If the bug you are reporting is potentially security-related - for example,
if it involves an assertion failure or other crash in `named` that can be

<!--
If you found the problem in BIND 9 using generative AI tools and you have verified it
yourself to be true: write the report yourself and explain the problem as you
have learned it. This makes sure the AI-generated inaccuracies and invented
issues are filtered out early before they waste more people's time.  Even if you
write the report yourself, you must make sure to reveal the fact that
generative AI was used in your report.

We ban users immediately who submit fake reports to the project.

### Summary

### Steps to reproduce

<!--
This is extremely important! Be precise and use itemized lists, please.

Even if a default configuration is affected, please include the full configuration
files _you were testing with_.

Example:
1. Use _attached_ configuration file
2. Start BIND server with command: `named -g -c named.conf ...`
3. Simulate legitimate clients using command `dnsperf -S1 -d legit-queries ...`
4. Simulate attack traffic using command `dnsperf -S1 -d attack-queries ...`

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

<!-- What you should see instead. -->

### Relevant configuration files

<!-- Paste any relevant configuration files here - please use code blocks (```)
to format console output. If submitting the contents of your
configuration file in a non-confidential issue, it is advisable to
obscure key secrets; this can be done automatically by using
`named-checkconf -px`. -->

### Relevant logs

<!-- Paste any relevant logs here - please use code blocks (```) to format console
output, logs, and code, as it's very hard to read otherwise. -->
